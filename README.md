Hello, my name is Thomas.

I'm a final year university student (Bachelor of Information Technology - Computer Science major, Intelligent Systems + Computational and Simulation Science minors).

I’m currently working on:
  - Various Minecraft Fabric mods:
    - [TextureAtlasGenerator](https://github.com/brainage04/TextureAtlasGenerator)
    - [HudRendererLib](https://github.com/brainage04/HudRendererLib)
    - [BrainageHUD](https://github.com/brainage04/BrainageHUD)
  - Refactoring and automating my Forge 1.8.9 modding template (see [MyForgeTemplate](https://github.com/brainage04/MyForgeTemplate)) like I've done with my Fabric latest version modding template (see [BrainageTemplateClient](BrainageTemplateClient))
  - My GitHub Pages website (still have a few things on the todo list + an update in the form of a blog containing various bits of information about my life)

I’m looking for help with:
  - Porting my Minecraft texture atlas generator from Forge 1.8.9 (see [DevUtils](https://github.com/brainage04/DevUtils)) to Fabric latest version (see [TextureAtlasGenerator](https://github.com/brainage04/TextureAtlasGenerator))
  - How to make my own Minecraft Forge 1.8.9/Fabric latest version config libraries that support Lists/dynamically sized arrays.

If you need help with anything Minecraft related (Forge 1.8.9/Fabric 1.20+), feel free to ask.

You can reach me via various socials which can be found in the [About](https://brainage04.github.io/about) section of my website.
