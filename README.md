Hello, my name is Thomas.

I'm a recent graduate from QUT Gardens Point with a Bachelor of Information Technology in Computer Science. I also have minors in Intelligent Systems + Computational and Simulation Science.

I’m currently working on:
  - Various Minecraft Fabric mods:
    - [ProceduralDungeon](https://github.com/brainage04/ProceduralDungeon)
  - Creating Forge 1.8.9 equivalents for my Fabric latest version modding templates (see [FabricTemplateClient](https://github.com/brainage04/FabricTemplateClient) and [FabricTemplateServer](https://github.com/brainage04/FabricTemplateServer))
  - Finding a full-time software development job! (If you think I'm what you're looking for, feel free to reach out at [thomasmcmah21@gmail.com](mailto:thomasmcmah21@gmail.com))

I’m looking for help with:
  - Porting my Minecraft texture atlas generator from Forge 1.8.9 (see [DevUtils](https://github.com/brainage04/DevUtils)) to Fabric latest version (see [TextureAtlasGenerator](https://github.com/brainage04/TextureAtlasGenerator))
  - How to make my own Minecraft Forge 1.8.9/Fabric latest version config libraries that support all primitives, Strings and especially Lists/dynamically sized arrays.

If you need help with anything Minecraft related (Forge 1.8.9/Fabric 1.20+), feel free to ask.

You can reach me via various socials which can be found on my [website](https://brainage04.github.io).
